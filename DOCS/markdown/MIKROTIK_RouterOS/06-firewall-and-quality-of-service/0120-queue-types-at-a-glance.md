## Queue types at a glance 

1. BFIFO (Byte-oriented First In, First Out): 

Features: BFIFO is a simple byte-oriented queuing discipline that sends out packets in the order they arrived and based on their size. Advantages: Simplicity and fairness in packet management. 

Disadvantages: BFIFO can lead to head-of-line blocking, where a large packet can delay all the smaller packets behind it. Also, there is no mechanism to prevent congestion or prioritize packets. 

2. PFIFO (Packet-oriented First In, First Out): 

Features: Like BFIFO but operates on a packet basis rather than bytes. 

Advantages: Easy to implement and understand. It's fair in terms of packet numbers. 

Disadvantages: Like BFIFO, it suffers from head-of-line blocking and doesn't have any congestion management mechanism. 

3. CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced): 

Features: A comprehensive queue management system designed to combat bufferbloat and ensure fair queuing. It combines CoDel, FQ, and other technologies. 

Advantages: Excellent at managing latency under any network condition. It's particularly useful in consumer broadband connections. Disadvantages: More complex to configure than simpler queuing disciplines. Not ideal for all use cases, particularly where fine-tuned control is required. 

4. CoDel (Controlled Delay): 

Features: CoDel aims to improve bufferbloat by dropping packets to control queue delay. 

Advantages: Good at managing latency and avoiding bufferbloat. 

Disadvantages: CoDel on its own does not provide fair queuing. 

5. FQ_CoDel (Fair Queuing Controlled Delay): 

Features: Combines the latency management of CoDel with fair queuing. 

Advantages: Excellent latency management and fair distribution of bandwidth among flows. Generally considered a good default choice. Disadvantages: More complex than simpler queue disciplines, which can make it harder to configure. 

6. MQ_PFIFO (Multiqueue Packet First In, First Out): 

Features: MQ_PFIFO is an extension of PFIFO that supports multiple queues. 

Advantages: Allows different queues for different types or priorities of traffic. 

Disadvantages: Still suffers from head-of-line blocking and lacks a built-in congestion management mechanism. 

7. RED (Random Early Detection): 

Features: RED aims to anticipate and prevent congestion by randomly dropping packets before the queue becomes full. 

Advantages: Helps to prevent congestion and can improve overall network performance. 

Disadvantages: Configuration can be complex and needs to be tuned for the network's specific characteristics. Misconfiguration can lead to reduced performance. 

8. SFQ (Stochastic Fairness Queuing): 

Features: SFQ aims to ensure a fair distribution of resources among flows by assigning them to different dynamic queues. Advantages: Helps to prevent a single flow from dominating the connection. 

Disadvantages: SFQ does not manage latency or congestion. The number of queues can also increase memory usage. 

In choosing a queue discipline, you'll need to consider the characteristics of your network and what you prioritize most, such as latency, fairness, simplicity, or congestion management.
