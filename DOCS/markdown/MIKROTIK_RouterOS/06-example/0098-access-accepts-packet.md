## Access-Accepts packet 

- Framed-IP-Address - IP address given to client. If address belongs to 127.0.0.0/8 or 224.0.0.0/3 networks, IP pool is used from the default profile to allocate client IP address. If Framed-IP-Address is specified, Framed-Pool is ignored 

- Framed-IP-Netmask - client netmask. PPPs - if specified, a route will be created to the network Framed-IP-Address belongs to via the Framed-IPAddress gateway; HotSpot - ignored by HotSpot 

- Framed-Pool - IP pool name (on the router) from which to get IP address for the client. If Framed-IP-Address is specified, this attribute is ignored Framed-IPv6-Prefix - IPv6 prefix assigned for the client Mikrotik-Delegated-IPv6-Pool - IPv6 pool used for Prefix Delegation Delegated-IPv6-Prefix - IPv6 Prefix Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool - IPv6 Prefix pool used for Prefix Delegation 

NOTE: if Framed-IP-Address or Framed-Pool is specified it overrides remote-address in default configuration. 

- Idle-Timeout - overrides idle-timeout in the default configuration 

- Session-Timeout - overrides session-timeout in the default configuration Port-Limit - maximal mumber of simultaneous connections using the same username (overrides te shared-users property of the HotSpot user 

- profile) 

- Class - cookie, will be included in Accounting-Request unchanged 

- Framed-Route - routes to add on the server. Format is specified in RFC 2865 (Ch. 5.22), can be specified as many times as needed 

- Filter-Id - firewall filter chain name. It is used to make a dynamic firewall rule. Firewall chain name can have suffix .in or .out, that will install rule only for incoming or outgoing traffic. Multiple Filter-id can be provided, but only last ones for incoming and outgoing is used. For PPPs - filter rules in ppp chain that will jump to the specified chain, if a packet has come to/from the client (that means that you should first create a ppp chain and make jump rules that would put actual traffic to this chain). The same applies for HotSpot, but the rules will be created in hotspot chain 

- Mikrotik-Mark-Id - firewall mangle chain name (HotSpot only). The MikroTik RADIUS client upon receiving this attribute creates a dynamic firewall mangle rule with action=jump chain=hotspot and jump-target equal to the atribute value. Mangle chain name can have suffixes .in or .out, that will install rule only for incoming or outgoing traffic. Multiple Mark-id attributes can be provided, but only last ones for incoming and outgoing is used. 

- Acct-Interim-Interval - interim-update for RADIUS client. PPP - if 0 uses the one specified in RADIUS client; HotSpot - only respected if radiusinterim-update=received in HotSpot server profile 

- MS-MPPE-Encryption-Policy - require-encryption property (PPPs only) 

- MS-MPPE-Encryption-Types - use-encryption property, non-zero value means to use encryption (PPPs only) 

- Ascend-Data-Rate - tx/rx data rate limitation if multiple attributes are provided, first limits tx data rate, second - rx data rate. If used together with Ascend-Xmit-Rate, specifies rx rate. 0 if unlimited. Ignored if Rate-Limit attribute is present 

317 

- Ascend-Xmit-Rate - tx data rate limitation. It may be used to specify tx limit only instead of sending two sequental Ascend-Data-Rate attributes (in that case Ascend-Data-Rate will specify the receive rate). 0 if unlimited. Ignored if Rate-Limit attribute is present 

- MS-CHAP2-Success - auth. response if MS-CHAPv2 was used (for PPPs only) MS-MPPE-Send-Key, MS-MPPE-Recv-Key - encryption keys for encrypted PPPs provided by RADIUS server only is MS-CHAPv2 was used as authentication (for PPPs only) Ascend-Client-Gateway - client gateway for DHCP-pool HotSpot login method (HotSpot only) 

- Mikrotik-Recv-Limit - total receive limit in bytes for the client Mikrotik-Recv-Limit-Gigawords - 4G (2^32) bytes of total receive limit (bits 32..63, when bits 0..31 are delivered in Mikrotik-Recv-Limit) Mikrotik-Xmit-Limit - total transmit limit in bytes for the client Mikrotik-Xmit-Limit-Gigawords - 4G (2^32) bytes of total transmit limit (bits 32..63, when bits 0..31 are delivered in Mikrotik-Recv-Limit) Mikrotik-Wireless-Forward - not forward the client's frames back to the wireless infrastructure if this attribute is set to "0" (Wireless only) Mikrotik-Wireless-Skip-Dot1x - disable 802.1x authentication for the particulat wireless client if set to non-zero value (Wireless only) Mikrotik-Wireless-Enc-Algo - WEP encryption algorithm: 0 - no encryption, 1 - 40-bit WEP, 2 - 104-bit WEP (Wireless only) Mikrotik-Wireless-Enc-Key - WEP encruption key for the client (Wireless only) Mikrotik-Wireless-VLANID - VLAN ID for the client (Wireless only) Mikrotik-Wireless-VLANID-type - VLAN ID type for the client. 0 - 802.1q tag and 1 - 802.1ad tag (Wireless only) Mikrotik-Switching-Filter - allows to create dynamic switch rules, when authenticating clients with dot1x server. Mikrotik-Rate-Limit - Datarate limitation for clients. Format is: rx-rate[/tx-rate] [rx-burst-rate[/tx-burst-rate] [rx-burst-threshold[/tx-burst-threshold] [rxburst-time[/tx-burst-time] [priority] [rx-rate-min[/tx-rate-min]]]] from the point of view of the router (so "rx" is client upload, and "tx" is client download). All rates should be numbers with optional 'k' (1,000s) or 'M' (1,000,000s). If tx-rate is not specified, rx-rate is as tx-rate too. Same goes for tx-burst-rate and tx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-time. If both rx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-threshold are not specified (but burst-rate is specified), rx-rate and tx-rate is used as burst thresholds. If both rx-burst-time and tx-burst-time are not specified, 1s is used as default. Priority takes values 1..8, where 1 implies the highest priority, but 8 - the lowest. If rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min are not specified rx-rate and tx-rate values are used. The rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min values can not exceed rx-rate and tx-rate values. 

- Mikrotik-Group - Router local user group name (defines in /user group) for local users; HotSpot default profile for HotSpot users; PPP default profile name for PPP users. 

- Mikrotik-Advertise-URL - URL of the page with advertisements that should be displayed to clients. If this attribute is specified, advertisements are enabled automatically, including transparent proxy, even if they were explicitly disabled in the corresponding user profile. Multiple attribute instances may be send by RADIUS server to specify additional URLs which are choosen in round robin fashion. 

- Mikrotik-Advertise-Interval - Time interval between two adjacent advertisements. Multiple attribute instances may be send by RADIUS server to specify additional intervals. All interval values are treated as a list and are taken one-by-one for each successful advertisement. If end of list is reached, the last value is continued to be used. 

- WISPr-Redirection-URL - URL, which the clients will be redirected to after successfull login WISPr-Bandwidth-Min-Up - minimal datarate (CIR) provided for the client upload WISPr-Bandwidth-Min-Down - minimal datarate (CIR) provided for the client download 

- WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Up - maxmal datarate (MIR) provided for the client upload WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Down - maxmal datarate (MIR) provided for the client download WISPr-Session-Terminate-Time - time, when the user should be disconnected; in "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD" form, where Y - year; M - month; D - day; T - separator symbol (must be written between date and time); h - hour (in 24 hour format); m - minute; s - second; TZD - time zone in one of these forms: "+hh:mm", "+hhmm", "-hh:mm", "-hhmm". 

The received attributes override the default ones (set in the default profile), but if an attribute is not received from RADIUS server, the default one is to be used.  Rate-Limit takes precedence over all other ways to specify data rate for the client. Ascend data rate attributes are considered second; and WISPr attributes takes the last precedence. 

Here are some Rate-Limit examples: 

- 128k - rx-rate=128000, tx-rate=128000 (no bursts) 

- 64k/128M - rx-rate=64000, tx-rate=128000000 

- 64k 256k - rx/tx-rate=64000, rx/tx-burst-rate=256000, rx/tx-burst-threshold=64000, rx/tx-burst-time=1s 

- 64k/64k 256k/256k 128k/128k 10/10 - rx/tx-rate=64000, rx/tx-burst-rate=256000, rx/tx-burst-threshold=128000, rx/tx-burst-time=10s
