## Enable Root guard 

In this example, ether1 is configured with `restricted-role=yes.` It prevented the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state) and remains so as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree.
